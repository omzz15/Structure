# Java Structures
This is a FTC specific version that runs on java 8. For more info check the main branch.

# Install
I would recommend using Maven or gradle for FTC projects.

## To Install with Maven:
1. In your project, make sure you can get libraries from Maven Central(This should be automatically available in maven projects)
2. Add the library to the project(by default it should be in the dependencies section of pom.xml)
   ```
   <dependency>
      <groupId>io.github.omzz15</groupId>
      <artifactId>supplier</artifactId>
      <version>2.1.0-FTCRELEASE</version>
   </dependency>
   ```

## To Install with Gradle
1. Add the mavenCentral() repository to the repositories section(it should be in build.gradle by default)
2. Add the library to the gradle using:
    ```
    implementation 'io.github.omzz15:supplier:2.1.0-FTCRELEASE'
    ```
Enjoy :)
